## üå± What Is Mind Garden?

Mind Garden is a modular, AI-powered backend system that orchestrates a team of specialized agents to deliver holistic mental health support.

- **Detect and assess risk** in real time from user conversations.
- **Automate triage and escalation** for high-risk cases, including appointment booking and emergency protocols.
- **Connect users to the right resources**‚Äîfrom professional help to peer support groups‚Äîbased on their unique needs and context.
- **Provide ongoing, supportive conversation** and schedule follow-ups for continuous care.
- **Capability to integrate with external APIs and databases** for up-to-date resources and peer support.
