# Mind Garden: Multi-Agent Crisis Response System

## Overview

Mind Garden is a mental health support system that uses a coordinated multi-agent architecture to detect, assess, and respond to users experiencing mental health crises. The system employs five specialized agents working in sequence to provide appropriate support based on the severity and nature of the user's situation.

## System Architecture

The system follows a sequential workflow with five specialized agents:

```
Detection Agent → Risk Assessment → Escalation Agent → Priority Routing → 
Resource Agent → Appointment Booking → Peer Agent → Match & Connect → 
Follow-up Agent → Proactive Monitoring
```

### Root Orchestrator Agent

The Root Orchestrator coordinates the entire workflow, managing the flow of information between specialized agents and ensuring appropriate handoffs occur based on assessment results.

**Responsibilities:**
- Receive and analyze initial user input
- Determine which agents to invoke and in what order
- Pass context and results between agents
- Compile final responses with summaries and recommended actions

## Specialized Agents

### 1. Detection Agent

**Purpose:** Serves as the first line of analysis for all user inputs, scanning for signs of emotional distress, crisis, or risk.

**Inputs:** User messages and conversation history
**Outputs:** Risk classification (none, mild, moderate, high) with reasoning

**Key Functions:**
- Pattern recognition for crisis indicators
- Initial classification of risk level
- Identification of emotional state and potential concerns

**Implementation Details:**
- Uses keyword analysis and semantic understanding
- Maintains a database of risk indicators and warning signs
- Passes risk assessment to the Risk Assessment Agent when concerns are detected

### 2. Risk Assessment Agent

**Purpose:** Performs deeper analysis on cases flagged by the Detection Agent to determine severity and appropriate response paths.

**Inputs:** User messages, conversation history, Detection Agent assessment
**Outputs:** Detailed risk assessment with recommended response level

**Key Functions:**
- Detailed analysis of risk factors
- Assessment of immediacy and severity
- Determination of appropriate response pathway

**Implementation Details:**
- Uses structured risk assessment frameworks
- Considers multiple factors including:
  - Expressed intent
  - Access to means
  - Previous history
  - Support systems
- Recommends appropriate escalation level

### 3. Escalation Agent

**Purpose:** Determines the appropriate routing for cases based on risk assessment and manages the priority of response.

**Inputs:** Risk assessment details, user context
**Outputs:** Escalation decision and routing information

**Key Functions:**
- Priority determination for cases
- Routing to appropriate resources
- Escalation to human intervention when necessary

**Implementation Details:**
- Implements triage protocols based on risk level
- Manages queue priority for different types of cases
- Provides emergency protocols for high-risk situations
- Coordinates with external emergency services when necessary

### 4. Resource Agent

**Purpose:** Identifies and recommends appropriate resources based on user needs and risk assessment.

**Inputs:** User context, risk assessment, escalation decision
**Outputs:** Resource recommendations and appointment booking options

**Key Functions:**
- Resource matching based on user needs
- Appointment scheduling with mental health professionals
- Information provision about support services

**Implementation Details:**
- Maintains database of mental health resources
- Uses search tools to find relevant external resources
- Provides information on crisis hotlines, support groups, and professional services
- Handles appointment scheduling logic and availability checking

### 5. Peer Agent

**Purpose:** Facilitates connections with peer support options when appropriate.

**Inputs:** User preferences, risk assessment, resource recommendations
**Outputs:** Peer support matches and connection details

**Key Functions:**
- Matching users with appropriate peer support options
- Facilitating initial connections
- Providing guidance on peer support interactions

**Implementation Details:**
- Maintains database of peer support options
- Implements matching algorithms based on experiences and needs
- Provides connection protocols and safety guidelines

### 6. Follow-up Agent

**Purpose:** Manages ongoing monitoring and follow-up for users after initial crisis response.

**Inputs:** User history, previous interactions, resource utilization
**Outputs:** Follow-up schedule, check-in messages, progress tracking

**Key Functions:**
- Scheduling follow-up interactions
- Monitoring progress and resource utilization
- Detecting changes in risk level over time

**Implementation Details:**
- Implements scheduling system for follow-ups
- Uses pattern recognition to detect changes in user state
- Provides continuity of care through persistent memory of user context
- Re-engages Detection Agent when new concerns arise

## Data Flow

1. **Initial Input Processing:**
   - User message received by Root Orchestrator
   - Root Orchestrator passes message to Detection Agent

2. **Risk Detection & Assessment:**
   - Detection Agent classifies initial risk level
   - If risk detected, Risk Assessment Agent performs detailed analysis
   - Assessment results passed to Escalation Agent

3. **Response Determination:**
   - Escalation Agent determines appropriate response pathway
   - For immediate risks, emergency protocols activated
   - For non-emergency cases, Resource Agent engaged

4. **Resource Provision:**
   - Resource Agent identifies appropriate support options
   - Appointment booking facilitated if professional help needed
   - Peer support options identified when appropriate

5. **Ongoing Support:**
   - Follow-up Agent schedules check-ins
   - Monitoring continues with periodic reassessment
   - New inputs restart the detection process

## Implementation Considerations

### Technical Requirements

1. **Agent Communication Protocol:**
   - Standardized JSON format for inter-agent communication
   - Structured data passing with context preservation
   - Error handling and fallback mechanisms

2. **Data Storage:**
   - Secure storage of user interaction history
   - Privacy-preserving design for sensitive information
   - Compliance with healthcare data regulations

3. **Integration Points:**
   - External resource databases
   - Appointment scheduling systems
   - Emergency services notification protocols
   - Peer support matching systems

### Safety & Ethics Considerations

1. **Crisis Protocol:**
   - Clear procedures for high-risk situations
   - Immediate escalation paths for suicidal ideation
   - Human oversight for critical decisions

2. **Privacy Protection:**
   - Data minimization principles
   - Secure handling of sensitive information
   - User consent mechanisms for data usage

3. **Effectiveness Monitoring:**
   - Ongoing evaluation of agent performance
   - Regular review of escalation decisions
   - Continuous improvement based on outcomes

## Future Enhancements

1. **Personalization:**
   - Learning from user interaction history
   - Customized resource recommendations
   - Adaptive response based on user preferences

2. **Integration Expansion:**
   - Additional resource databases
   - More specialized peer support networks
   - Direct integration with healthcare providers

3. **Modality Extensions:**
   - Voice-based interaction support
   - Image/video analysis for additional signals
   - Multi-platform support (mobile, web, messaging)
